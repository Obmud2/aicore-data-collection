            "description": "This beautiful Lotus Elise has only 1 previous owner from new, the first owner had the car for 3 years, the current owner owned the car for just over 9 years. It comes with every single service invoice and has been maintained to the highest of standards throughout its life. This gentleman kept the Lotus in a garage and never used it in the rain or even if it was even slightly damp. It was his dream car  and he was going to keep it for life, unfortunately he now has back problems and just physically could not use the car hence his reluctant sale. This is one of the rare first Series 3 models with only 5 currently for sale on AutoTrader (6 including this one). The main difference you'll find between the series 2 and 3 is build quality, lotus continually improve build quality so newer models will appear better built, less rattles, less leaks and a better-quality interior.
